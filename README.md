# Codewars - Solutions

Hello and welcome to this repository!

I created this repo specifically to track my solutions to katas.
I'm still rusty on data structures and algorithms so this repo 
will help me assess my coding skills over time.

I intend to solve (by giving my best) at least five challenges every day 
for thirty days consecutively. That will amount to 150 challenges, not optimal 
but it's a good start.
